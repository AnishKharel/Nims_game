# Nims_game

This project was an extension of an active class assingment we did which consisted of making the algorithm that will always win in the mathematical game of Nims. We looked at the different ways of solving such a problem using such as Graph Theory. We had to stimulate our algorithms win rate using python. I took it a step farther and made an interactive UI for anyone to play and try to beat my algorithm.
